# mousehunt scripts

A couple of scripts to make it more convenient to play [Mousehunt](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/).<br>
* [autohunt.py](#autohunt)--A script to automate some aspects of MH.
* [mhconsole.py](#mhconsole)--A console-like interface for interacting with the game.
* [shuffle.py](#shuffle)--A small script to automate solving Spooky Shuffle in MH's Halloween 2022 event.

To run these scripts, you'll need python with the [requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).

*The use of any of these scripts is against [Mousehunt's rules](https://hitgrab.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-mousehunt/faq/44-scripts-auto-clickers-and-software).* The usual disclaimers follow.

## autohunt.py
This script automates some aspects of MH. It's most basic function is to sound the horn regularly. It also has options to automate things like travelling, changing the trap setup, buying and crafting things, etc., according to the requirements of some quests. 

### Basic usage
Change the first few lines of the script to include some form of valid credentials (either username + password or an active session cookie), then run the script without arguments. If the credentials provided are valid, the script will start and sound the horn at 15-20 mins intervals continually until you abort it.

On successful login, the session cookie is printed to the console. For stealthiness, it's advisable to save the cookie value in the script so that the script logs in using the cookie next time instead of a password--the former is more similar to non-bot behaviour.

### Parameters
Three parameters govern the rate at which the horn is sounded.
* Interval: The minimum waiting time in mins between horns
* Randomness: The length in seconds of the interval from which the waiting time will be randomly chosen
* Miss probability: The probability of missing a horn

These parameters have default values of 15 mins, 300 secs, and .15 respectively (wait between 15-20 mins between horns, miss 15% of the time). These can be overwritten with the -i, -r, and -m options, respectively. 

There are also preloaded sets of non-default values for convenience. Running autohunt with the -A option puts it in aggressive mode, in which the horn sounds roughly every 15 mins without missing. Running autohunt with the -P option puts it in paranoid mode, in which autohunt waits between half to one hour between horns and misses 20% of the time.

### King's reward
When KR appears, in the default configuration, autohunt reports 'antibot triggered', downloads the KR image to your device, opens it automatically, then waits for input. From here, you have three options. If you just press enter at the prompt, autohunt opens the image again. If you enter 'url', the image url is printed. If you enter anything else, that's interpreted as an attempt to solve KR. If the code is correct, autohunt resumes.

You can run autohunt in silent mode with -S, in which the KR image isn't opened automatically. Or, you can run autohunt in out-of-band mode, in which the script doesn't expect any input but simply refreshes the page at regular intervals checking to see if KR has been solved. Use the -O option to set the interval in secs between refreshes.

### Cycles
Running autohunt with one of the preset cycles will automate some game actions that might be taken between horns, usually according to the requirements of a quest. Choose the cycle with -C, and if there are parameters for that cycle, set them with -z.

|halloween|Halloween 2022 event<br>Hunt with highest level cheese.<br>Brew where possible; cheese before roots|Access to event location|r: Don't brew root<br>b: Don't use bonefort|

### Other features
**User-agent.** For stealthiness, autohunt tries to replicate the http headers that would have been sent with requests made from a browser. The User-Agent header is customisable, and you should choose the one corresponding to the browser on which you normally play MH. If you run autohunt with the -ua option set to these pre-defined values, the User-Agent header will be set accordingly:
* 'firefox': firefox on windows (this is the default value)
* 'chrome': chrome on windows
* 'edge': edge on windows
* 'mac': safari on mac
* 'iphone': safari on iphone

If you set anything else as the value of ua, the User-Agent header is set to that.

**First wait.** When autohunt starts, the first horn is sounded as soon as available and without missing. To delay the first horn, set the value of the -w option to the time in minutes (from the time the script is started) the autohunt should wait before the first horn.

**Logging.** If you want to log the hunts made with autohunt, run autohunt with the -L option set to the location of the log file you want to use (it doesn't have to exist yet). Some stuff about each hunt will be logged to that file, and you can do whatever data stuff you want to with it.

<a name="mhconsole"/>

## mhconsole.py
This is intended to be a companion script to autohunt. It creates a CLI for interacting with the game, so you can do simple things like move or buy things between horns while autohunt is running, without going to the trouble of accessing the game in-browser.

### Logging in
As with autohunt, you can login either using your MH username + password or an active session cookie. You can either modify the first few lines of the script to input your credentials, or submit them after mhconsole has started. If you choose the latter, mhconsole will start with an unauthenticated session. From here, enter 'help' to see your options

![consoleunauth](img/consoleunauth.png)

Enter 'user [username]' to give the script your username, and likewise for your password or cookie. Enter 'show' to check the credentials you submitted, and 'login' to attempt to login with those credentials. You'll need either a valid username+password combination or a valid cookie to login. If your login is successful, the script will say so and the prompt will show your username:

![consoleauth](img/consoleauth.png)

If you input your credentials directly to the script, you'll see the authenticated prompt immediately on starting mhconsole.

### Functions
From an authenticated session, enter 'help' to see your options

![consolehelp](img/consolehelp.png)

I think most of these are quite intuitive. For instance, 'info' shows you stuff about your current setup:

![consoleinfo](img/consoleinfo.png)

'hammer' shows you the things on which you can use the Hunter's Hammer. To use the Hammer, enter 'hammer' followed by the serial number of the thing you want to hammer, followed optionally by the quantity you want to hammer. If you don't provide a quantity, it defaults to 1. If you enter 0 for the quantity, it hammers all of that item you have.

![consolehammer](img/consolehammer.png)

Most of the other functions work similarly to the above two examples.

### Antibot
If KR is triggered, mhconsole suspends until it's solved. You'll see '(antibot)' at the prompt. From here, the options are pretty much the same as with autohunt:

![consoleantibot](img/consoleantibot.png)

Anything else you type other than 'show', 'url', 'logout', 'exit', or 'quit' will be interpreted as an attempt to solve KR. The script will make sure it's 5 alnum chars before submitting. If the code is correct, mhconsole will resume by executing the last command you gave before KR was triggered.

If you're running mhconsole simultaneously with autohunt, there's a chance KR will be solved via autohunt while mhconsole is in antibot mode. If that's the case, you can get mhconsole to exit antibot mode by entering any 5 alnum chars at the prompt. 

![consolerace](img/consolerace.png)

The reason this is necessary is because I didn't want mhconsole to request the page too often while in antibot mode, since that's an indicator of botting. So it only sends requests when you input something that can be submitted as a KR code.

<a name="shuffle"/>

## shuffle.py
In Oct 2022 MH had a Halloween event with a card-matching game. This script automates solving the game using what I think is an optimal algorithm--theoretically, it takes between 1-8 tickets to solve; practically, it usually takes between 4-6 tickets. 

It takes one required argument and two optional arguments: <br>
(1) A cookie value or the alias of a cookie value saved in the cache dict--required.<br>
(2) An integer from 0-3 indicating the level of the game to play--optional if you've an ongoing game, required if you don't.<br>
(3) Put any string as the third argument to start an upgraded version of the shuffle board, if you've the spooky dust (can't remember what it's called) to do it.
<br><br>
![shuffle](img/shuffle.png)

If you've an ongoing game, the script will resume that. Otherwise, it will start a new game using the parameters you gave it.
